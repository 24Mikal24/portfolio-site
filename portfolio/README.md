This is my personal website. It was a project generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6 and is hosted on an S3 bucket. I used Terraform to create and deploy the infrastructure on which the website is hosted, which includes route53 and cloudfront configuration, as well as a simple lambda/API gateway setup to handle the website's contact form.
